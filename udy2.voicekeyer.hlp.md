"         The UDY-2 Voice Keyer software utility allows the user to create multiple message groups storing up to four messages. Each message mey be between 4 to 30 seconds in length. Each message group can store a maximum of four messages.

"         The message groups should be created with descriptive names allowing them to be easily identified as they are recalled for subsequent use without having to remember what their purpose is.






"         The four messages stored in each message group may be given descriptive names allowing them to be easily identified as they are selected for transmission.

"         The messages stored for message one and message two may be either four to thirty seconds in length or eight to sixty seconds long. Message three and message four may be four to thrity seconds long.

"         With the message mode switch in the 4x4 position it is possible to store 4 messages of 4 to 30 seconds long.

"         With the message mode switch in the 2x8 position it is possible to store 2 messages of 8 to 60 seconds long.

"         As messages are recorded and stored for each message button the red message LED indicator will light up indicating that a message is queued up and ready to be transmited.

"         When a message is stored in a message group the tooltip for the corresponding message button includes the message group name and message name assigned to that button.

"         For example placing the mouse pointer over the message one message button in the screenshot above will cause the tooltip to read "Play Message: 14.300 MMSN \ Net Preamble"

"         Each message may be configured to repeat up to 99 times with a programmable delay between transmissions of between 1 to 30 seconds. These settings are message independant and correspond to the individual messages stored in each message group.

"         The Reset command button allows all repeat and delay settings for the active message group to be reset to 1.






"         A seperate station ID message may be stored allowing 10 minute station ID's to be handled by the UDY-2 Voice Keyer and not occupying a message group storage location.

"         The MEMO button must be selected prior to recording a Station ID message.

"         To record a Station ID message select the MEMO button. The RED LED should begin to blink. The ID timer display will be used to display recording time remaining after recording begins. Next select the Station ID button to begin recording. When recording is complete the Station ID message will be saved automatically. When a station ID message has been recorded and saved the red LED indicator for the station ID will illuminate.

"         Selecting the Station ID command button will transmit the Station ID message then start a 10 minute timer. When the timer has counted down the Station ID message will be re-transmited then the station ID timer will reset. As designed the Station ID timer is set for 10 minutes and is asysynchronous with the Station ID message so the timer will continue counting down even as the station ID message is played.

"         Up to 60 seconds of receive audio may be recorded from off the air for audio comparisons or to try to assist with getting information from those hard to copy signals by replaying the receive audio recording.

"         The receive audio buffer may be saved to a wave file for sharing, future reference, or comparison.

"         With receive audio connected to your computers sound card line in click the REC command button to begin recording the receive loop.

"         Click STOP to stop recording the receive loop.

"         Click PLAY to play back the recorded receive audio.

"         NOTE: Right click PLAY to transmit while playing back the RX audio loop. This helps when working with adjusting the remote stations audio settings so they can hear how they sound on your end.

"         If you want to save the recorded receive audio to a wave file just click the Save RX Loop command button, then click the Save command button on the dialog that appears. The file will be saved with a name indicating the date and time of the recording.

"         To view the folder where the receive audio files are stored click Explore on the Save RX Loop dialog.

"         The Audio In and Audio Out command buttons allow easy access to the Windows Mixer Recording controls and Windows Mixer Volume controls respectively.

"         The Auto Port Select checkbox allows UDY-2 Voice Keyer to scan the selected serial communications port for the presence of a modem. If a modem is present UDY-2 Voice Keyer is designed to prompt you to select a different port. If the port is disabled in hardware or not physically present or if another software application has captured the selected port UDY-2 Voice Keyer is designed to prompt you that the port is unavailable allowing you to select another port.

"         Flow Control is handled with the RTS and DTR pins on the selected serial communications port. When UDY-2 Voice Keyer is transmitting either the RTS or DTR or both RTS and DTR pins are toggled to a high logic state to key the transceiver. Refer to your serial interface instructions when selecting the flow control to make sure the correct pin is being activated.

"         To test the selected serial communications port make sure that your interface is connected to the selected serial port and powered on. Then click the Test Port command button. This will invoke a short test that should toggle the selected port on and off a few times. If the interface indicates activity or if the transmitter is attached and keys up then the test is successful. During the test red indicator LED's will flash on when the selected port is active then switch off when the selected port is inactive.

"         Both transmit and receive message quality are independantly user selectable. There are twelve combinations of audio capture formats to choose from. Select 6000Hz - 8 Bit and Mono for a low quality format resulting in a small file size. Select 11025 Hz and Stereo for a higher quality format resulting in a larger file size. Select 44100 Hz -16 Bit and Stereo for a high quality format resulting is a large file size.

"         For TX purposes select as high a quality as you prefer. With modern hard drives, space should not be a concern considering the short file durations of the message files being recorded by UDY-2 Voice Keyer.

"         For RX loop capture purposes choose as high a quality of format as you prefer. If you plan to send a wave file captured by the UDY-2 Voice Keyer RX loop as an e-mail attachment keep in mind the size of the resulting file before recording. If either you or the recipient of the file uses a dial up connection then 11025 Hz - 8 Bit Mono may be a good choice for the RX Messages format. A file will approximately double in size when Stereo is selected.

"         Click the Always On Top checkbox to allow the UDY-2 Voice Keyer window to remain floating on top of other windows.

"         Click Finish to close the dialog after configuring the audio and serial port settings.

RX Audio Receive Loop

"         Receive audio may be recorded, played back, and saved to a wave file for future reference or to send to the station you are listening to so they can hear first hand how they sound at your end ot the path.

"         The RX buffer length is adjustable between fifteen to sixty seconds in the Program Settings Dialog.

"         RX audio from your transceiver should be routed into your sound cards line input jack for RX audio recording to occur.

"         Click Save to save the receive buffer to a file. Click Explore to open Windows Explorer to the folder where UDY-2 Voice Keyer stores the receive audio files.

"         NOTE: When listening to stored receive audio files that were captured after more than the maximum RX audio buffer length the audio may sound out of sequence depending on when the recording process is stopped. This is due to the method the system uses to overwrite audio in the receive capture buffer.

"         For best results when recording receive audio for storage and playback record up to the maximum RX buffer length value set in the Program Settings Dialog then store the captured receive audio to a file. For example if the RX buffer length is set to thirty seconds record up to but not more than thirty seconds of audio for saving and future playback. By following the steps outlined above. This will help to ensure that the audio is in the correct sequence in the saved file.
