This is the schematic.

The one I got did not have a power cable.
The power adapter on the radio is a Cinch Jones type adapter.  Thanks to some help at vetco electronics I was able to get an end that I could use to create an adapter.

Using the schematics, I was able to figure out that 4 was ground (negative) and 3 was 13.V DC (positive).  The other are for 120V and 220V which I did not intent do use at this point.
After wiring up the adapter I was able to successfully receive (fm) and send (cw).  More likely work, but thats all I tried for the time being.
